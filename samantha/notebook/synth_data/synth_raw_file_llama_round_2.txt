**Applicant**: Yeah, that sounds interesting. Please do send me more info.

**Maria**: Awesome! Thanks for being so prompt. Next, I need you to answer a two-question assessment to evaluate your skills. It's a simple form, and I'll share it with you here. [shares the form] Please take your time to answer the questions in two paragraphs each.
