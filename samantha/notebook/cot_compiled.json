        "question": "Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky.  Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald.  How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?",
        "rationale": "produce the answer. We know that Reginald counted 12 shooting stars and Sam counted 16 shooting stars. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them is (14 + 12 + 16) \/ 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.",

        "question": "Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?",
        "rationale": "produce the answer. We first add the number of pencils she bought on Monday and Tuesday, which is 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. Then we find out how many pencils she bought on Wednesday by tripling the number of pencils she bought on Tuesday, which is 18 * 3 = 54 pencils. Finally, we add the total number of pencils she has by adding the pencils from each day, which is 38 + 54 = 92 pencils.",

        "gold_reasoning": "Wendy\u2019s dentist bill was 5 * $120 = $<<5*120=600>>600. She got two fillings at a cost of 2 * $120 = $<<2*120=240>>240. Thus, Wendy paid $600 - $240 - $70 = $<<600-240-70=290>>290 for the tooth extraction.",
