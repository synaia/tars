Maybe you can ask what they need and find a way to fix the problem. It's good to stay calm and not be angry. You can offer a solution to make them happy again. Remember to be polite and show you care about their feelings. This can help to keep things nice and make them feel better. Being nice and helpful is a good way to handle tough times on WhatsApp.\n",
